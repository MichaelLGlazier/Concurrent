Solves the classic problem of missionaries and cannibuls crossing a river using monitors as a form of concurrency control.
LOGIC:
he program creates the cannibals and the missionaries, along
with a boat and an initialization thread. The initialization
thread sets the monitor then closes and allows the rest to start
up. The missionaries and cannibals run in an infinite loop while 
the boat runs b times. Each person attempts to enter a boat, with 
some limitations such as a maximum of three passangers and less
cannibals then missionaries or all cannibals on the boat. If a
person gets on the boat they wait until they are dropped off by
the boat. Any body who tries to enter the boat after its full
has to wait and try again later. After the boat runs b times
anybody who tries to enter the boat is sent away.
